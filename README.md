# 🎯 TFT Comp Suggester  
**GraphDB + RAG–powered Teamfight Tactics composition assistant**

> A research-oriented backend system that combines **structured TFT game data**,  
> **Graph Databases**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to suggest optimal  
> team compositions during live TFT gameplay.

## ✨ Motivation

Teamfight Tactics decisions are **contextual, combinatorial, and patch-dependent**.  
This project explores how **Knowledge Graphs + LLMs** can reason over structured game
state (champions, traits, augments, items, patches) instead of relying on prompt-only heuristics.

The long-term goal is to evolve this into:
- a **live in-game assistant**
- a **graph-native RAG system**
- a **research sandbox** for AI + Knowledge Graph integration

## 🧠 Core Ideas

- **Graph-first representation** of TFT data (Champions, Traits, Augments, Items, Patches)
- **Patch-aware knowledge isolation**
- **RAG pipeline** grounded in factual, queryable game knowledge
- **LLM reasoning constraine**
